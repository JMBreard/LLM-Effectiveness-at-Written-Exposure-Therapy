# LLM-Effectiveness-at-Written-Exposure-Therapy
My project seeks to better understand the effectiveness of AI in written exposure therapy (WET), an emerging and promising form of PTSD therapy. 

My project seeks to better understand the effectiveness of AI in therapeutic roles. As a quick background, my grandfather served in the military during the Vietnam War, and I believe that he suffered from PTSD. I served in the Navy as a reactor operator aboard a submarine, so I am sympathetic to the idea that the military can impose a psychological burden on servicemembers. This is most clearly evident when comparing PTSD rates among combat veterans to the general public. I believe that AI can assist in aiding this burden, not only supporting military servicemembers, but everyone.
