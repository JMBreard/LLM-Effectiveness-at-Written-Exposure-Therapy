# LLM-Effectiveness-at-Written-Exposure-Therapy
My project seeks to better understand the effectiveness of AI in therapeutic roles. As a quick background, my grandfather served in the military during the Vietnam War, and I believe that he suffered from PTSD. I served in the Navy as a reactor operator aboard a submarine, so I am sympathetic to the idea that the military can impose a psychological burden on servicemembers. This is most clearly evident when comparing PTSD rates among combat veterans to the general public. I believe that AI can assist in aiding this burden, not only supporting military servicemembers, but everyone.
